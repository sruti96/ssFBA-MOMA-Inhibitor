## Constraint-Based Models for Cell-Free Protein Synthesis

### Introduction
This repository contains code for flux balance analysis (FBA) and minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA).


### Installation and Requirements

To run the scripts, clone this repository using the command:

	git clone https://github.com/sruti96/ssFBA-MOMA-Inhibitor

[Julia](https://www.julialang.org) v1.5 or greater must be installed on your machine. In addition, the following packages are required: ``GLPK.jl``, ``DelimitedFiles.jl``, ``TOML.jl``, ``CSV.jl``, ``DataFrames.jl``, ``Logging.jl``, ``Gurobi.jl``, ``Dierckx.jl``, ``Convex.jl``, ``PyPlot.jl``.

In the ``src`` directory, there are two subdirectories ``ssFBA`` and ``MOMA`` which contain the code for the sequence specific FBA model and the MOMA model.

### Scripts
The subdirectories contain scripts to run or analyze the problem:

Script | Description
---: | ---
``run_ensemble.jl`` | Runs FBA to generate an ensemble. Saves solutions in the ``Ensemble`` directory for the respective case.
``plot_ensemble.jl`` | Plot the simulations generated by the ``run_ensemble.jl`` script.
``TTA.jl`` | Runs MOMA for the TTA case. Saves solutions at the path ``Ensemble\tta``.
``DNP.jl`` | Runs MOMA for the DNP case. Saves solutions at the path ``Ensemble\dnp``.
